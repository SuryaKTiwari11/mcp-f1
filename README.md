# F1 API MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides access to Formula 1 driver and team data.

## Description

This project implements an MCP server that exposes Formula 1 driver and team data through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The server provides access to information about F1 drivers and teams, including both current and historical data.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd mcp-f1

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Usage

### Running the Server

```bash
# Start the server
npm start
```

### Configuring Claude to Use This MCP Server

To use this MCP server with Claude, you need to configure Claude to recognize and connect to it:

1. Locate your Claude configuration file (usually at `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`)

2. Add the following configuration to enable the F1 MCP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "f1": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:/Users/SURYA/Desktop/mcp-f1/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Adjust the path in the `args` field to match where you've installed the project.

4. Restart Claude for the changes to take effect.

### Troubleshooting

If the F1 server shows as "Disabled" in Claude:

1. Make sure you are running the server with `npm start` and that it is not crashing.
2. Check that the path in your Claude configuration points to the correct location of `index.js`.
3. Ensure there are no errors in your Node.js installation (Node.js 18+ recommended).
4. Make sure you are not outputting anything to stdout except valid JSON (do not use `console.log`, only `console.error` for debugging).
5. Check Claude's logs for any error messages.
6. Ensure your `index.js` and all function files use ESM (import/export) syntax, not CommonJS (require/module.exports).
7. If you make changes to the code, simply restart the serverâ€”no build step is needed for JavaScript.
